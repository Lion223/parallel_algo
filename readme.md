# parallel_algo
Use of parallel algorithm representation by implementing the local-recursive algorithm for matrix multiplication

Example in app:

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lion223/parallel_algo/master/example.jpg)

Matrix A is uniquely defined and depends only on the dimension of the data
Matrix B: the shaded area is arbitrary integers other than zero, not the shaded area is zeros
